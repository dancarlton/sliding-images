# sliding-images
This repo is the code I built for the sliding images and how they function in my portfolio

Recommendations:
1. Use photos that are 1600px x 1600px or larger. Just make sure they are naturally landscape images and a good amount of pixels so the scrolling effect works well and the image is not blurry.
